Methodology
The state of media survey sought to establish number of Kenyans using broadcast media, print media platforms and various indicators in the usage of internet, digital and social media platforms in Kenya. The survey targeted Kenyans aged 15+ years living in rural and urban domains. 

Data collection questionnaire was scripted on Kobo platform. This allowed for daily monitoring of submitted data and promptly spot any issues therein. 
The questionnaire was scripted onto Kobo platform and loaded to each enumerator’s phone during training. Enumerators then piloted the tool and ensured that everything was working as intended. During data collection interview geolocation points were recorded and at the end of each day, data was uploaded to the server. Submitted data were then reviewed and validated to ensure quality measures are adhered to. 
The survey managed to collect data from 3,589 respondents, which surpassed the targeted sample size of 3,512 by 77 responses. 

Data Analysis
Upon completion of data collection, data was to be processed and analysed using Microsoft Excel and Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). This was the consultant’s choice because the team’s interaction with the software over time has led to enhanced proficiency with each software in various tasks. The goal of data processing was to clean data: check for inconsistencies, anomalies, missing values and outliers.
Quantitative data provided numerical values to selected responses emanating from a predetermined list of closed-ended questions. Using a scale, respondents were expected to rate levels of various factors identified in the survey. Descriptive statistics were created to identify a pattern of the data and consistency of the responses in each of the factors assessed. 
The outcome of the data analysis were summary tables, charts and graphs that were compiled into a report and interactive Dashboard.
